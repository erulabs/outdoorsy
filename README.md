## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn

yarn dev
```

If you don't like HTTPS for local development, you can also use:

```
yarn http
```


If you want use the containerized stack (requires Kubernetes and Skaffold - works great with Docker Desktop or Rancher Desktop!), you can use:

```
./scripts/k8s.sh
```
